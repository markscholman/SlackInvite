#Slack invite page for AzureStackEU blog.
Based on the layout of http://slack.azurewebsites.net/ i created a azure funtion that runs the backend for invoking the API call to Slack and invite the person

Frontend is a simple HTML page that runs a javascript when hitting submit that takes the email and send it to the Azure function
